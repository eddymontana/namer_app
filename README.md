About The Project
Namer App is a user-friendly application for managing and categorizing a collection of names, ideal for role-playing games, fantasy authors, or genealogical research.

It aims to: 

Creative Block/Inspiration Deficiency:

Problem: Users (writers, game developers, parents, product managers, etc.) struggle to come up with unique, fitting, or memorable names for characters, places, products, projects, babies, pets, or even Wi-Fi networks.

How Namer App Solves It: It provides a mechanism to generate, suggest, or combine names based on various criteria (themes, origins, syllables, phonetics), breaking creative deadlocks.

Consistency and Thematic Cohesion:

Problem: In complex projects (e.g., a fantasy novel series, a large software system), maintaining consistent naming conventions across many entities can be difficult, leading to a disjointed feel.

How Namer App Solves It: It can enforce rules, generate names within a specific thematic "universe," or help categorize and manage existing names to ensure consistency.

Uniqueness and Avoidance of Duplicates:

Problem: In systems where names must be unique (e.g., usernames, product IDs, character names in a game where duplicates are forbidden), manually checking for uniqueness is tedious and error-prone.

How Namer App Solves It: It can generate names that are guaranteed to be unique within a given dataset or check user-provided names against a database to prevent collisions.

Meeting Specific Naming Criteria/Constraints:

Problem: Names might need to adhere to certain rules (e.g., maximum length, no special characters, must contain a vowel, specific cultural origins). Manually validating these can be time-consuming.

How Namer App Solves It: It can validate names against predefined rules or generate names that automatically satisfy those constraints.

Organization and Management of Name Inventories:

Problem: Users might have lists of names they like or have used, but no efficient way to store, categorize, search, or retrieve them.

How Namer App Solves It: It can act as a database or management system for names, allowing users to tag, filter, and save their name collections.

Features
[Feature 1]: Generates names based on customizable themes (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, real-world cultures).

[Feature 2]: Supports filtering results by length, starting letter, or specific keywords.

[Feature 3]: Allows users to save favorite names to a personal list.


Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

[Language/Runtime]: [e.g., Python 3.8+ or Node.js 16+]

cd namer_app
(Replace your_username with your actual GitHub username.)

Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended for Python projects):

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
Install project dependencies:

Bash
